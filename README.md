# Project1

## Evan Foemski's First Project

### Description

In this Project I followed the acceptance Criteria while also attempting to keep the page in the web browser as similar to the example as possible. I encountered a couple struggles during this project and as I got further and further into it I still never seemed to be 100% happy with my work, however I got pretty close to 100%. The webpage I worked on consisted of a Media Optimization company. I made sure all the links were working, added a more descriptive title, and added "ALT" attributes to each of the images. On top of that to the best of my ability, I made sure the source code had Semantic HTML elements, not just "DIV", made sure the code followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, and put the heading attributes in sequential order.
